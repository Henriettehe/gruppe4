      <p><img src="./img/police.jpg" alt="Police" class="half right">I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. He taught me a code. To survive. Makes me a … scientist. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. You're a killer. I catch killers.</p>
      <p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Makes me a … scientist. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I like seafood.</p>
      <p>Only you could make those words cute. God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
      <p>Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. You look…perfect. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
      <img src="./img/police.jpg" alt="Police" class="wide">
      <p>You look…perfect. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Tell him time is of the essence. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>
      <p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!</p>
      <img src="./img/police.jpg" alt="Police" class="contained">
      <p>I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Like a sloth. I can do that. Only you could make those words cute. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</p>
      <p>Keep your mind limber. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</p>
      <p>You're a killer. I catch killers. Only you could make those words cute. I have a dark side, too. I like seafood. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>
